title: My first website
author: Raul Cotar

I've been wanting to make a website for myself for quite some time now, but I never mustered the will to touch web development, not even in such a small capacity. Until now that is. This is the first version of my personal blog, a place where I intend to post short articles about my works and researches and random ideas I have.

One of the goals with this website was to be made completely from scratch - free of convoluted frameworks, dozens of external dependencies and proprietary scripts.
At the time of writing this article, the smallest amount of JS I could get away with was a single 6 lines long function used for theme switching. The rest is mostly hand-written HTML and CSS.

I write the posts in Markdown and I convert them to HTML using Pandoc with a custom template. Deploying is literally just running the script and pushing to GitHub. You can check out the repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/RaulCotar/RaulCotar.github.io).

The website is pretty rough now - there is almost no padding and alignment going on - but that should just take a day of tinkering or so. After that it's off to the races working on projects to actually have something to write about.

Thanks for reading my very first blog post.
