        server</h1>
        <p>The <strong>M</strong>iniscale <strong>E</strong>fficient
        <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>W</strong>eb
        <strong>S</strong>erver is the newest addition in my suite of
        applets that I write during lectures and late at night. As the
        name implies, it is just a simple server designed to serve
        static pages while not draining too much battery life - which it
        achieves. You can check it out <a
        href="https://github.com/raulcotar/meows">on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>I intend to use it as a local server for viewing pages of
        this website while I work on them, and that is reflected in the
        current design and implementation. Especially the latter, it isâ€¦
        not great. String processing in particular is done in a pretty
        janky way. On the flip side, it is pretty quick and simple
        (&lt;180 LOC!) and supports multiple clients.</p>
        <p>A version 2.0 is planned. The main 2 functional changes will
        be:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>server-sent events - a must for my usecase</li>
        <li>the MEOWS <em>library</em> and API - to enable scripting and
        on-demand page generation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Considering this is my first interaction with web sockets,
        that I wrote everything in a text editor without any plugins,
        and that I was half asleep during most of the 2-day-long
        development process, I am quite happy with the results I got so
        far.</p>
