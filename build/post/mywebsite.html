    <p>Iâ€™ve been wanting to make a website for myself for quite some
    time now, but I never mustered the will to touch web development,
    not even in such a small capacity. Until now that is. This is the
    first version of my personal blog, a place where I intend to post
    short articles about my works and researches and random ideas I
    have.</p>
    <p>One of the goals with this website was to be made completely from
    scratch - free of convoluted frameworks, dozens of external
    dependencies and proprietary scripts. At the time of writing this
    article, the smallest amount of JS I could get away with was a
    single 6 lines long function used for theme switching. The rest is
    mostly hand-written HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>I write the posts in Markdown and I convert them to HTML using
    Pandoc with a custom template. Deploying is literally just running
    the script and pushing to GitHub. You can check out the repository
    <a href="https://github.com/RaulCotar/RaulCotar.github.io">on
    GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>The website is pretty rough now - there is almost no padding and
    alignment going on - but that should just take a day of tinkering or
    so. After that itâ€™s off to the races working on projects to actually
    have something to write about.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading my very first blog post.</p>
