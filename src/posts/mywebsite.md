My first website
===

I've been wanting to make a website for myself for quite some time now, but I never mustered the will to touch web development, not even in such a small capacity. Until now that is. [This](../archive/index.html) is the first version of my personal blog, a place where I intend to post stuff about myself, short articles about my works and researches and random ideas I get.

## Technical details
One of the goals with this website was to be made completely from scratch - free of convoluted frameworks, dozens of external dependencies and proprietary scripts.
At the time of writing this article, the smallest amount of JS I could get away with was a single 6 lines long function used for theme switching. The rest is mostly hand-written HTML and CSS.

I write the posts in Markdown and I convert them to HTML using Pandoc with a custom template. Deploying is literally just running the script and pushing to GitHub. You can check out the repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/RaulCotar/RaulCotar.github.io).

## Future plans
There are 2 main things I have in mind:
1. Improve visuals (layouts and colors)
2. Migrate to another host, possibly self-hosted.
3. **Write more posts**
